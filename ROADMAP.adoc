= PolyCore Roadmap
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble
:icons: font

This document outlines the development roadmap for rescript-poly-core, the foundation library for the Hyperpolymath ReScript ecosystem.

== Vision

PolyCore aims to be the definitive foundation library for building ReScript applications and MCP servers in the Hyperpolymath ecosystem. It provides battle-tested utilities, consistent patterns, and infrastructure that enables rapid development of reliable software.

== Current Status

**Phase: Alpha (v0.1.x)**

Core functionality is implemented and working. The library is suitable for experimental use but APIs may change before v1.0.

|Promise utilities with retry, throttle, debounce

|Core.Logger
|✅ Complete
|Structured JSON logging with child contexts

|Core.Config
|✅ Complete
|Environment and JSON configuration loading

|MCP.Protocol
|✅ Complete
|MCP types, schema builders, argument parsing

|MCP.Server
|🔶 90%
|Server builder, tool registration, request handling
|===

== Milestones

=== v0.1.0 - Foundation ✅

_Target: Q1 2025_

* [x] Core.Result - Result type extensions
* [x] Core.Async - Promise utilities
* [x] Core.Logger - Structured logging
* [x] Core.Config - Configuration loading
* [x] MCP.Protocol - Protocol types and builders
* [x] MCP.Server - Server infrastructure
* [x] Basic documentation
* [x] Deno configuration

=== v0.2.0 - Testing & Quality

_Target: Q1 2025_

* [ ] Unit tests for all Core modules
* [ ] Unit tests for MCP modules
* [ ] Integration tests for MCP server
* [ ] CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
* [ ] Code coverage reporting (target: 80%)
* [ ] Automated formatting and linting

=== v0.3.0 - Ecosystem Integration

_Target: Q2 2025_

* [ ] Publish to JSR (jsr:@hyperpolymath/rescript-poly-core)
* [ ] Example MCP server project
* [ ] Integration with poly-mcps
* [ ] Version compatibility matrix
* [ ] Migration guide from direct implementations

=== v0.4.0 - Extended Utilities

_Target: Q2 2025_

* [ ] Core.JSON - JSON parsing and schema validation
* [ ] Core.Http - HTTP client with retry and circuit breaker
* [ ] Core.Cache - In-memory caching with TTL
* [ ] Core.Queue - Simple async task queue
* [ ] MCP.Transport - Stdio and HTTP transport implementations

=== v1.0.0 - Stable Release

_Target: Q3 2025_

* [ ] API stability guarantee
* [ ] Comprehensive documentation
* [ ] Performance benchmarks
* [ ] Security audit
* [ ] Production deployment guides
* [ ] LTS commitment

== Future Directions

=== v1.x - Maintenance & Refinement

* Performance optimizations based on production usage
* Additional utilities based on ecosystem needs
* Expanded MCP protocol support as spec evolves

=== v2.0 - Next Generation

_Tentative, subject to ecosystem evolution_

* WASM compilation support
* Cross-platform MCP transport
* Enhanced observability (OpenTelemetry integration)
* Schema-first API design

== Non-Goals

These are explicitly out of scope for PolyCore:

* **Web framework** - See poly-web for HTTP servers, routing, middleware
* **CLI framework** - See poly-cli for argument parsing, commands, TUI
* **Database ORM** - Each project should choose appropriate data layer
* **Node.js support** - Deno-only by design
* **React/UI components** - Frontend concerns are separate

== Contributing to the Roadmap

We welcome community input on the roadmap:

1. **Feature requests** - Open an issue with the `enhancement` label
2. **Priority feedback** - Comment on existing roadmap issues
3. **Implementation** - PRs welcome for any roadmap item
